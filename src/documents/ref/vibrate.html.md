<b>vibrate</b> vibrates the phone or tablet that's running Doggie And Me.

Just like <code><a href="feed.html">feed</a></code>, this only actually happens when you're running the game in the Doggie And Me app.

And also just like <code><a href="feed.html">feed</a></code>, you can call <code>vibrate</code> using <code>()</code> or <code>do</code>:

<code class="jumbo">vibrate<span data-dfn="really do it">()</span></code>

or

<code class="jumbo"><span data-dfn="just do it">do</span> vibrate</code>

both do the same thing.
