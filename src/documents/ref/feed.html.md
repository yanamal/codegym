<b>feed</b> gives the dog a treat!

When the game is running inside the Doggie And Me app, this tells any connected feeders to dispense a treat. In this playground, it will just tell you that it's feeding the dog.

<code class="jumbo">feed<span data-dfn="really do it">()</span></code>

The parentheses are important - they tell the computer to actually do the command. In programmer jargon, you are <b>calling</b> the <code>feed</code> <b><a href="functions.html">function</a></b>.

You can also use <code><a href="do.html">do</a></code> instead of parentheses to call <code>feed</code>:

<code class="jumbo"><span data-dfn="just do it">do</span> feed</code>

This does the same thing. You can use whichever one makes more sense to you.
