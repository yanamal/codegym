<h1>Reference</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Code Gym reference library.</p>

<p>To use this library:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Click on any topic on the left.</b>  Feel free to browse any
topics you would like to learn more about.
<li><b>Try out the examples on the pages.</b>  Nothing is saved,
so you can try anything you like.
  <ul>
    <li> If the example has a <span style="background-color:cadetblue">&nbsp blue </span> &nbsp background, it only works in Doggie And Me projects.
    <li> If it has a white background with a grid, it will work in any <a href='http://pencilcode.net'>Pencil Code</a> project.
  </ul>
<li><b>Copy the ideas that you like back into your Code Gym projects.</b>
Project areas are linked in the menu at the top.
</ol>

<p>Happy browsing.</p>
