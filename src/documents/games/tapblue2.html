  The four-color game is hard for dogs, too. We can make it easier by changing the size of the blue box with a <code>DifficultyPicker</code>: Start with it taking up the whole screen, and slowly reduce the size until it's the same as the other boxes!

      There's one more thing I changed in this version of the Blue Tap game: I put <code>blue</code> last in the <code>boxColors</code>array. Can you guess why? <em>Tip: </em>Try putting it in the middle of the array, and see what happens!

  - title: OK, one last thing...

      The first time I wrote this game, it was 156 lines long - almost 5 times longer than this one! But I didn't have Doggie And Me commands like <code>DifficultyPicker</code> and <code>onRoundStart</code> - I just wrote it all by hand.

  # the hardest size is the "regular" size.
