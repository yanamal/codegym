  Let's bring the difficulty up a notch - both for the dog and the programmer! There are 3 new things happening in this version: 
  We made a <code>new DifficultyPicker</code> and we called it <code>sizePicker</code>. Then, <code>onRoundStart</code> (so each round), 
  we use the DifficultyPicker to <code>pick</code> a new size.<br>
  <em>Hint:</em> is the code too long? try switching from blocks mode to text mode.
instructions:
  - title: onRoundStart
    mission: >
      Everything inside <code>onRoundStart</code> will happen each time a new round starts - so all the set-up for a new round of the game should go here.<br>
      Try moving the <code>moveto random position</code> line inside <code>onRoundStart</code> - can you tell what changes in the way the game works?

      <code>DifficultyPicker</code> is magic! So hopefully it's worth the extra complexity. 
      It will automatically pick a difficulty setting based on how well the dog did the previous round. You always need two parts to make a DifficultyPicker: the declaration, where you tell it the range of numbers to pick from, 
      and the actual picking, which should usually be inside <code>onRoundStart</code>, to pick a new difficulty level each round.
      In this example, <code>sizePicker</code> will pick a turtle size between 20 (easiest) and 1 (hardest). The turtle size will use the difficulty setting because we used <code>sizePicker.pick</code> to <code>setSize</code>.
code: |
  st()
  sizePicker = new DifficultyPicker(20, 1)
  onRoundStart ->
    setSize sizePicker.pick()
  turtle.tap ->
    feed()
    moveto random position
