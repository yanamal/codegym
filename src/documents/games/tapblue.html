  <b>Whoa!</b> lots of stuff going on here: loops, arrays, ifs, variables... It's OK if this is all new to you - even if you don't understand everything in a program yet, you can still customize it!<br>
  The "Learn More" sections will give you some ideas for changing this game.<br>
  I'll try to add a more gentle introduction to all these things later, but for now, you can read some of the references below, or check out <a href='http://gym.pencilcode.net'>Pencil Code Gym</a> for non-dog-centric tutorials!
instructions:
  - title: Speed it up!
    mission: >
      In this game, the dog is supposed to tap on the blue rectangle. The turtle draws 4 new rectangles at the beginning of each round. But the turtle is kind of slow - plus, we don't really need to see it for this game!
      Try removing <code>st()</code> (on line 2), and in its place, putting  <code>speed 100</code> or even <code>speed Infinity</code>!
  - title: Change the colors!
    mission: >
      On line 12, we set <code>boxColors</code> to be an <em>array</em> of four colors. If you change the colors in the array, the turtle will draw your new colors! 
      <em>Note: </em>if you use less than 4 colors, the turtle will get confused. If you use more than 4, it will only use the first 4. Try it and see!<br>
      You can also change which color is the "correct" one by changing which color we use in the <code>if</code> on the second-to-last line.
  - title: Dogs and colors
    mission: >
      Dogs are red-green colorblind (or something like it). They are pretty good at blue and yellow, though!
code: |
  # show the turtle, so we know what it's doing:
  st()

  # define some useful numbers and colors:
  boxSize = max(totalWidth, totalHeight)/2
  boxCenters = [
    [-boxSize/2, -boxSize/2]
    [-boxSize/2, boxSize/2]
    [boxSize/2, boxSize/2]
    [boxSize/2, -boxSize/2]
  ]
  boxColors = [blue, yellow, white, black]

  # on round start, randomize box position and draw 4 boxes
  onRoundStart ->
    cg() # clear graphics
    shuffle boxCenters # randomize the order of the box centers
    for i in [0..3] # for each of the 4 box centers/colors
      moveto boxCenters[i] # move to the current center
      box boxColors[i], boxSize # draw a box of the current color
    
  # on tap, see if the tap was on blue. if yes, feed the dog!
  tap ->
    if lasttap.touches blue
      feed()
