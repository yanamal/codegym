  A very simple dog game: whenever the dog <code><a href="/ref/tap.html" target="reference">taps</a></code> the blue screen, the game <code><a href="/ref/feed.html" target="reference">feeds</a></code> it a treat. Click the play button to start the simulation, then click on the blue part of the screen to simulate nose-taps!<br>
  "Learn More" will tell you how to change the game, and how to deploy games to the Doggie And Me app.

  - title: The code of the game
    mission: >
      The code (or program) is how we define the game. This first game is just <code>tap -> feed()</code>!<br>
      Did you know there are two ways of viewing and changing the code? This example started out in block mode, but you can switch to text mode by clicking  
      <span  height="40" style="background-color:#8fbfef;color:white;height:25px;padding:5px" class="glyphicon glyphicon-indent-left"></span> or <img src="/images/texttoggle.png" height="25px"/> below.
  - title: Changing the code
    mission: >
      If you add <code><a href="/ref/vibrate.html" target="reference">vibrate()</a></code> directly under <code>feed()</code>, then the game will tell your tablet or phone to vibrate right after dispensing a treat!
      (Though in the playground, it'll just tell you to pretend it vibrated)<br>
      You can add code by dragging it out of the palette in block mode, or just by typing in text mode.
  - title: Deploying the game
    mission: >
      To deploy the current game to your Doggie And Me app, first click the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-qrcode"></span> button below. 
      After a second, you'll see a QR code (it looks kind of like that button). Then go to the "Add Game" section in your app, and scan the code. The app should load your game!<br>
      <em>In case you're wondering:</em> the deploy button creates a new <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/#secret-gists">secret anonymous gist</a>, and the QR code is just a link for the app to know where to download the code!
