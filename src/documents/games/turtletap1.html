  Did you know that there's always a <code>turtle</code> hiding in your game?
  We can use <code>st()</code> to Show Turtle. Then we can listen for taps on the turtle, and only feed when the turtle is tapped - not the screen around it.
instructions:
  - title: Bigger Turtle
    mission: >
      The turtle is kind of small! We can make it bigger by using <code>setSize 5</code> (or even bigger than 5!)

      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot)' target='_blank'>Turtle robots</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics' target='_blank'>Turtle graphics</a> are classic ways of teaching people how to program! Turtles give us a fun and easy way to draw and move things on the screen. We can move turtles around, make them draw, ask them what they are touching, and more!
code: |
  # this is a comment - it does nothing
  st() # this shows the turtle
  turtle.tap ->
    feed()
