      <h2> What is it?</h2>
      This is an interactive playground for writing treat-dispensing games that work in the Doggie and Me app (using a <a href='https://smartanimaltraining.com/'>PetTutor</a> treat dispenser) - and also for learning how to write them in the first place!<br>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>There are lots of examples to learn from. Each example has an explanation at the top, and a reference to all the commands at the bottom. You can run and change the example as much as you like, then deploy your version to the Doggie And Me app. </p>
      <small>(If you just want to see what's possible, there's also a link to a big reference page on the top-right.)</small>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h2>What do I do?</h2>
      <p>Not sure how to start? The button below will take you to the first very simple example - play around with it, then try the next example, then the next, and so on!

    <p>This playground is based on the <a href='http://gym.pencilcode.net'>Pencil Code Gym</a>, and the Doggie And Me games also use <a href='http://pencilcode.net'>Pencil Code</a>'s turtle graphics.
